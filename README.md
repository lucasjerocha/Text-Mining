# Text-Mining-with-R
This repository contains code and resources for text mining tasks including exploratory analysis, text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The analysis is performed on comments from both employees and customers.

Text mining is the process of extracting meaningful information and insights from textual data. In this repository, we apply various text mining techniques to analyze comments provided by both employees and customers. The goal is to uncover patterns, sentiments, and topics present in the data.

## Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory analysis involves gaining an initial understanding of the textual data through statistical and visualization methods. In this section, we explore the characteristics of the comments dataset, such as word frequency distributions, common phrases, and basic statistical properties.

## Text Classification

Text classification is the task of categorizing text documents into predefined classes or categories. In this repository, we implement text classification algorithms to automatically assign labels to comments based on their content. These labels could represent different topics, sentiment polarities, or other relevant categories.

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. In this section, we employ sentiment analysis techniques to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral. By understanding the sentiment of comments, organizations can better gauge customer and employee satisfaction levels.

## Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a method for discovering abstract topics present in a collection of documents. In this repository, we utilize topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to uncover latent themes within the comments dataset. By identifying topics, organizations can gain insights into the main subjects discussed by both employees and customers.
